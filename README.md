By the power of JANK I release this into the world.

TBH I just want other people to be able to look at it while I'm asleep, I'll (hopefully? possibly? maybe?) fix this after I wake up.

Uhhhh... usage instructions....

fuckit, i need sleep

your hint is that it needs mongodb to work

figure out the rest yourself, y'all seem smart.

or just wait until I sleep and try to fix this clusterfuck.

goodnight
